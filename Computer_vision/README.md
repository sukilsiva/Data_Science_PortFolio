COMPUTER VISION

SETTING UP:


It is generally encouraged that you always use Python virtual environment to have isolated Python installations per project. In this guide, I suggest you do the same. So 'cd' into the directory that you've cloned onto your computer and perform the following actions to run the notebooks in a separate virtual environment.


python3 -m venv env

source /env/bin/activate

pip3 install -r requirements.txt

jupyter notebook

Opening Notebooks

In every notebook is self-contained and demonstrates end-to-end flow of actions that must be taken to accomplish a given task. The name of a notebook file suggests its purpose.


Once you've started jupyter notebooks with the command jupyter notebook you must open http://localhost:8888/ in your browser to see the tree of files and directories.


Click on the notebooks folder and select your notebook of choice to see the code demonstration.
